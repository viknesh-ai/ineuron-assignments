#How do I write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both includeded)?The numbers obtained should be printed in comma seperated
#code
lst = [i for i in range(2000, 3201) if i % 7 == 0 if i % 5 != 0] 
print(lst)
